# TandyGame

This is a small DOS game. It started out as a game for the Tandy 1000, but as the hardware was too obscure it is now for "normal" DOS machines. The 16 color palette of the Tandy 1000 is still used though.

As the game is a 16bit DOS application it will not work natively on modern Windows machines, especially not on 64bit machines. To run it on such machines you need some kind of an emulator. I recommend [Dosbox](https://www.dosbox.com/).

## Hardware Requirements
 * An 8086/8088 CPU or better
 * A VGA compatible graphics adapter
 * 640kb of RAM. Less might work but is untested.
